### What is it about?

Lockdown Cybersecurity Competition for High School invites high schoolers to compete at the University at Buffalo. Teams of high school students (max 5 per team) will engage in hands-on competition, and tasked with defending a small network of systems from attack, and will be scored on how well their services remain available (service uptime). Teams will also be assigned and scored on various timed tasks to complete throughout the event. If that's not enough, a Cybersecurity CTF and other interesting challenges will be part of the competition as well!

We welcome teams of all skill levels to join this fun and educational competition. You and your teammates will have an opportunity learn about cybersecurity in a supportive atmosphere of friendly competition. 


### When and where?

The competition is offered both online and in-person at UB on **March 7, 2026** from 9:30am to 4:00pm.
